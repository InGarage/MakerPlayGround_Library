Alphanumeric LCD
- change backlight color (how to infer a single color / multicolor / RGB LCD?)
	It let you choose from color picker in HTML, so I think choose every color is the best. The program will compute color in RGB hex format.
- Is it possible to set text color?
	There are 2 types of Lcd color. First, fixed black text color but blacklight is not. Second, text color depends on blacklight color.
- How to show text on the screen?
	Allow user to type it at most 32characters, and use some external lib to show it. 
- Create custom control for show text
	I think at this time textbox with 32characters is the best.
Motor
- create step and servo as a separate category
	I gonna do that.
Clock
- How to get current time? => is it possible to create a function that will be invoke for a specific thing

	In Rpi, yes! If you want, I gonna do.
